                        <h3>Are there any geographical restrictions?</h3>
                        <p>Answer for <strong>clients</strong>: If you are booking an appointment, it is best to choose a professional from your home country to avoid any time zone or language issue. However, you can choose to book an appointment with professionals from abroad. Just message them first to make sure they accept clients from abroad. <br />
                           Answer for <strong>professionals</strong>: Depending on your occupation and your professional license, you may be permitted to practice only in your home state. For example, lawyers and doctors may only offer their services in states that they are licensed to practice. In that case, you can only accept clients who are from those states. Otherwise, if the service you offer has no geographical restriction, you can accept clients from anywhere in your country or even abroad.

                        <h3>What should I include in my professional profile?</h3>
                        <p>Answer: Be sure to include a clear, professional picture of yourself. Clients make a lot of decisions based on what they can see. State clearly what service you offer: English Teacher, Fitness Instructor, Money Manager, Legal Advisor, etc. Explain briefly how your expertise can help potential clients.</p>
